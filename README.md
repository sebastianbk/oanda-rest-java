# OANDA API Wrapper with 64-bit Integer Support

This fork uses 64-bit integers in many of the project's methods to align with OANDA's new REST API.

## Thanks

Thanks to [rabun](https://github.com/rabun/oanda-rest-java) for creating the initial project. This repository is a fork of rabun's original project with the only difference being the added support for 64-bit integers.
